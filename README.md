# Puppeteer <> Vitest <> Workers Assets

This Worker contains tests which are run with [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/). This is a useful tool for testing applications which use [static assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/), (in particular, [full-stack frameworks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/frameworks/)).
